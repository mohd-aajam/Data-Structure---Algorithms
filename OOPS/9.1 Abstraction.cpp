/* “shows” only essential attributes and “hides” unnecessary information. 
The main purpose of abstraction is hiding the unnecessary details from the users 
A class has the responsibility to determine which data member is to be visible outside and which is not.

How to implement abstraction
Using access specifiers we can decide which data member to be visible and which data member to be visible

ADVANTAGES
->Only you can make changes to your data or functions.
->It makes the application secure by not allowing others to see background details
->Increases the reusability of code
