/* What OOPs means?
The basic concept of OOPs is to create objects, re-use them throughout the program, and manipulate these objects to get results.
OOPS works on the principles of abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

what is object
If anything that has behavior and structure so we can call it object
Eg variables in our class is structure and function is behaviour of our object


What is a class?
-Class is a user defined data type or we called it template, which contains some values, known as data member and member function.
collection of similar kind of object eg a fruit class has mango,apple,banana but it will not have Laptop


-->In case of empty class out object will get 1 byte of memory to track the recored of class
